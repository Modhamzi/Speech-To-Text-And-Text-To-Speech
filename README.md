# Speech-To-Text-And-Text-To-Speech
## **SPEECH TO TEXT**
First, I define the libraries I need. Then I configure the commands. Then I call the variables and include the audio file within the program. Then, I do the command to write the audio content in the form of text.
## **TEXT TO SPEECH**
First, I download the IBM file, and then I download a particular file for Python. I then enter the text-to-speech conversion in the IBM file. Then, I need to enter the verification transformation of the speech found in the file Ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators.
I enter the API address that I created within the IBM site. I define the text_2_speech variable that makes the IBM site validation. I explain the file in which I want to save and its type. Then I write the sentence I want to convert into speech and ask the programmer to memorize the result.
